My name is Rongxiang Su (pronounced as Rong-sheeyang), and I am a Teaching Assistant Professor in the [Department of Urban and Regional Planning](https://urban.illinois.edu/people/profiles/rongxiang-su/) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I hold a Ph.D. in Geography from the University of California, Santa Barbara. 

My research interests lie in geospatial data science, human mobility, travel behavior, and urban analytics. Broadly, my work seeks to understand human mobility, travel behavior, and activity patterns in urban systems by analyzing human-generated data such as mobile phone traces, household travel surveys, and various emerging urban big data. I am particularly interested in developing computational methods to identify and quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of daily activities and interactions. In parallel, I aim to examine disparities in human behavior by modeling and predicting activity-travel patterns across diverse socio-geographic contextsâ€”ultimately contributing to more sustainable, equitable, and inclusive transportation systems and access to urban opportunities. I am always enthusiastic about discussing research and potential collaborations. Feel free to email me at <ins>rsu at illinois dot edu</ins>!


**I am not accepting PhD students currently. However, if you are interested in working with me: 1) Current UIUC students are welcome to schedule a meeting with me to discuss potential independent study projects.
2) Students from other institutions may join my group as visiting scholars. Please feel free to email me to discuss possible collaborations.**
