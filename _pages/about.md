Hi there! My name is Rongxiang Su. I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [MIT Senseable City Lab](https://senseable.mit.edu/) (January 2024 - present). I earned my PhD in Geography from the [Department of Geography](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/) at the [University of California Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/). My research focuses on movement analysis, human mobility and activity pattern analysis, travel behavior, accessibility and space-time modeling. I also serve as a peer reviewer for several academic journals and conferences. In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis, cooking, listening to podcasts, and exploring national parks! Feel free to reach out! I am always enthusiastic about discussing research.
