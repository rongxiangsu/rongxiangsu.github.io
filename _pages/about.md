My name is Rongxiang Su (pronounced as Rong-sheeyang) (he/him), and I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at [MIT Senseable City Lab](https://senseable.mit.edu/). I hold a Ph.D. in Geography from the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research interests include geospatial data science, human mobility, travel behavior, and urban analytics. My work focuses on **understanding human mobility, travel behavior, and activity patterns in urban systems through the analysis of human-generated data** (e.g., mobile phone traces, household travel surveys, and online food delivery orders). I am particularly interested in developing computational methods to identify and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of human daily activities and interactions. In parallel, I aim to understand disparities in human behavior by modeling and predicting activity-travel patterns across different socio-geographical contexts, contributing to the promotion of sustainable, equitable, and inclusive transportation systems and access to urban amenities.

To date, I have published 20 peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, or conference proceedings (11 first-author journal articles) in GIScience and transportation and beyond (e.g., ecology and social sciences). Many of these appear in prestigious journals such as *Computers, Environment and Urban Systems*, *Journal of Geographical Systems*, *Journal of Transport Geography*, *Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies*, *Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice*,  *Transactions in GIS* (also featured at the research session at the 2022 ESRI User Conference), and *Movement Ecology*.
In addition to my research, I serve as a peer reviewer for more than 28 academic journals and conferences. I am always enthusiastic about discussing research and potential collaborations. Feel free to email me at <ins>rxsu at mit dot edu</ins>!
