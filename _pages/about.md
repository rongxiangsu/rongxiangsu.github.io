Hi there! My name is Rongxiang Su. I am an incoming Postdoctoral Research at [MIT Senseable City Lab](https://senseable.mit.edu/). I earned my PhD in Geography from the [Department of Geography](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/) at [University of California Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/). My research interests include movement analysis, human mobility and activity pattern analysis, travel behavior, accessibility and space-time modeling. I was the recipient of the 2022 Jack and Laura Dangermond Fellowship and the 2022 UCSB Geography Excellence in Research Award. I also serve as a peer reviewer for multiple academic journals and conferences. In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis, cooking, listening to podcasts, and exploring national parks!
