Rongxiang Su (he/him) is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at [MIT Senseable City Lab](https://senseable.mit.edu/). He holds a Ph.D. in Geography from the University of California, Santa Barbara. His academic interests include spatial data science, human mobility, travel behavior, and urban analytics. He is interested in developing new computational methods for identifying and quantifying spatiotemporal patterns of human daily activities and interactions, using both conventional travel diaries and extensive movement data from individuals. His research contributes to equitable and sustainable transportation by developing comprehensive models that effectively predict travel behavior at a fine temporal granularity. Additionally, his research unravels the intricate relationships between the built environment and peopleâ€™s daily behavior. Beyond his research, he also serves as a peer reviewer for several academic journals and conferences. For contact, he can be reached at rxsu at mit dot edu. His CV is available [here](http://rongxiangsu.github.io/files/Rongxiang_Su_CV.pdf).
